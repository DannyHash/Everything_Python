Write a Python script that:
Takes user's name and birth year via input.
Calculates their age (assume itâ€™s 2025).
Stores a list of random numbers.
Loops through the numbers to:
Print whether each is even/odd.
Count how many numbers are greater than the personâ€™s age.
Use functions to:
Greet the user.
Calculate age.
Analyze the number list.
