Task:
Write a Python program that does the following:
Declares a variable name and assigns it your name.
Declares a variable age and assigns it your age.

"""

name = "Danny"
age = 23

print(f"Hello, my name is {name}")

if age >= 18:
    print("I am an adult.")
else:
    print("I am a minor.")

# The program declares a variable name and assigns it your name.
